Project: Calculator

This project looked at simulating a simple calculator in bash script. The calculator prompts the user for an operand, then an operator and then a second operand. The answer is displayed after each calulation. The subsequent operation uses the previous result, the answer, as the first operand. 

The operand can accept: any digit, MR, MC, C, X
The operator can accept: +, -, *, /, MS, M+, MC, C, X

The functions perform the following actions: 
C: Clear result, keep memory
MS: Stores result to memory
M+: Adds result to memory
MR: Recalls the value in memory
MC: clears the memory
X: Off, exits Unix
